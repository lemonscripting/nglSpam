# nglSpam

This project provides a toolset to spam messages to users on ngl.link with enhanced anonymity and spoofing features which ultimately crashes the user's mobile client. 

The project includes two main components: `disguise.js` and `spam.js`.

## Features

- **Anonymity**: `disguise.js` hides your identity while spamming, providing a layer of anonymity. It works best when used with a VPN for optimal results.
- **Request Spoofing**: `spam.js` spoofs request details, allowing you to spam a targeted username with custom messages.
- **Anti-Detection**: Integrated anti-detection methods in request headers to make it nearly impossible to detect the source of the spam.
